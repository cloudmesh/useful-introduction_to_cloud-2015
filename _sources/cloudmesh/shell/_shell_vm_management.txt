Initialization

A simple import allows you to enable all features of Cloudmesh in
Python.

.. code:: python

    import cloudmesh
.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("help")

.. parsed-literal::

Activating Clouds
-----------------

In order for cloudmesh to work with multiple coulds, we need to find out
first which clouds are available. Users can add their own clouds later
which we describe in the registration section.

Let us inspect what is already available by invoking the list command

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("cloud list")

.. parsed-literal::

    +---------+----------+
    | cloud   | active   |
    +=========+==========+
    | alamo   |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | aws     |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | azure   |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | hp      |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | hp_east |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | india   | True     |
    +---------+----------+
    | sierra  |          |
    +---------+----------+
    


As you see we have a number of clouds, but none of them is already
active. Thus we need to first activate a cloud. We assume that you have
an account on FutureGrid. Let us activate the cloud india

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("cloud on india")
We also have a conveniet interactive selector to select a cloud to work
with, that however does not work with ipython

::

    "cloud select"

or you may also input "cloud select india" to select a specific cloud
india

To check if the cloud was activated, simply use the list command again

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("cloud list")

.. parsed-literal::

    +---------+----------+
    | cloud   | active   |
    +=========+==========+
    | alamo   |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | aws     |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | azure   |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | hp      |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | hp_east |          |
    +---------+----------+
    | india   | True     |
    +---------+----------+
    | sierra  |          |
    +---------+----------+
    


Start a VM
----------

Now let us see how to start VMs on a cloud, here is how to start a VM on
cloud india

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("vm start --cloud=india --image=futuregrid/ubuntu-14.04 --flavor=m1.small")
You may don't know what images or flavors are available on the cloud, or
you don't want to type a long command every time you start a VM, things
can get a lot easier by performing some setting up...

Set a default flavor or a default image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each cloud must have a default image and a default flavor to launch vm
instances in a simple step. The cloud set command provides a way to set
default values for an image or a flavor.

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("cloud set flavor india --flavorid=2")
.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("cloud set image india --image=futuregrid/ubuntu-14.04")
Get Flavors or Images
---------------------

Available flavors can be listed with the following command.

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("list flavor india --refresh")
refresh option updates the data from the IaaS cloud. The cached data in
the mongo database will be updated.

The ``list image`` command provides an available vm images on a selected
cloud.

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("list image india --refresh")
Quick Start a VM
----------------

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("vm start --cloud=india")
Delete a VM
-----------

If you know the id of the virtual machine that you want to destroy,
*delete* command in cloudmesh simply terminate the instance.

.. code:: python

    cloudmesh.shell("vm delete [NAME] --cloud=india")
More options to launch a VM instance
------------------------------------

When you create a new VM instance, you can also choose multiple options
such as a flavor, an image, or a key associated with the instance. The
``vm start`` command accepts optional parameters as a user input of
these options. To see a brief description of the command, try
``cm "vm --help"`` in the IPython Notebook cell.

Available options are:

-  --cloud= give a cloud to work on, if not given, selected or default
   cloud will be used
-  --count= give the number of servers to start
-  --flavor= give the name of the flavor
-  --flavorid= give the id of the flavor
-  --group= give the group name of server
-  --id= give the server id
-  --image= give the name of the image
-  --imageid= give the id of the image
-  --prefix= give the prefix of the server, standand server name is in
   the form of prefix\_index, e.g. abc\_9
-  --range= give the range of the index of the servers to delete, e.g.
   --range=3,6. standand server name is in the form of prefix\_index,
   e.g. abc\_9
-  --force delete vms without user's confirmation

.. code:: python

    cloudmesh.shell("vm start --cloud=india --flavor=m1.medium --image=futuregrid/ubuntu-12.04")
Vitual Machine Name
-------------------

In Cloudmesh, the default name of VM consists of your username and a
number, for example, alex\_1. ``label`` command allows you to manage or
modify the VM name as you wish.

.. code:: python

    cloudmesh.shell("label")



.. parsed-literal::

    prefix:  Brian
    index:  32
    next VM name: Brian_32



.. code:: python

    cloudmesh.shell("label --prefix=Alex --id=40")



.. parsed-literal::

    



.. code:: python

    cloudmesh.shell("label")



.. parsed-literal::

    prefix:  Alex
    index:  40
    next VM name: Alex_40



If the user doesn’t provide a name while starting VMs, cloudmesh will
generate labels for them. The default form to name VMs is prefix\_index,
where prefix is a string and index is an non-negative integer. If a
index is used, the index value will be automatically added by one
waiting to be used for next VM. To check your current prefix and index

Set a default cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to make things even more convenient, you can set a default
cloud or select a cloud to work with so that you don't have to type in a
cloud everytime you need to specify a cloud, to set india as default
cloud

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("cloud set default india")
to select a cloud

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("cloud select india")
You can see a selected cloud as a temporarily default cloud to work
with.

For more details of using command cloud to set up a cloud

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("cloud -h")
After all setting up above, now you can start a VM simply by typing in

Refreshing VM status
--------------------

After you have started or deleted VMs, you may want to check clouds' VMs
status. To refresh cloud india's VMs information

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("list vm india --refresh")
Starting multiple VMs
---------------------

Sometimes we want to start more than one VM at the same time, we can
choose the option --count=int where int is the number of VMs you want to
start. For example, to start 5 VMs on india

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("vm start --cloud=india --count=5")
Deleting VMs
------------

To delete one VM is easy, what if we want to delete 1000 VMs, we need a
more convenient way to do it. Cloudmesh shell provides several methods
to find the VMs and delete them, you may think there are two phases of
VM deletion, searching and deleting. Here are some examples:

to delete all VMs of cloud india

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("vm delete --cloud=india --force")
Note here we use the option "--force", without it the shell will give
you a list of VMs to delete and ask for your confirmation.

to delete a VM by giving its name (you may always provide a cloud unless
you have specified a default cloud or have selected a cloud)

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("vm delete --cloud=india abc_2 --force")
to delete a VM by group

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("vm delete --cloud=india --goup=testgroup --force")
We can also narrow the search result by giving more search conditions.
For example, to delete VMs of cloud india that they are also in the
group 'testgroup' and they have the prefix name 'abc' and their indices'
range is no greater than 100

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("vm delete --cloud=india --goup=testgroup --prefix=abc --range=,100 --force")
For more details for command vm

.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.shell("vm -h")
