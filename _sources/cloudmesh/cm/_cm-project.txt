The ``project`` command provides a list of default, active, or completed
project for a given user. You can update the project information with
this command.

.. note:: that all your ``project`` command executions update your yaml
file (cloudmesh.yaml) and mongo db (user, defaults) both.

IPython Alias
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the alias command we simply define a new command with the name cm
that we can call directly from IPython. Here we make sure that the
parameters ar between "" so that they are properly set. Just execute the
following lines.

.. code:: python

    alias cm cm %s

We are using now one of the methods to call the cm commands in the
following sections.

``project info`` Command
------------------------

The ``project`` command has a number of options that are useful to
manage a list of projects. The ``info`` option provides a current
information on your account.

.. code:: python

    cm project info


.. parsed-literal::

    
    Project Information
    -------------------
    
       default: fg2
      projects: fg2, fg82, fg415
     completed: fg1003
    


Set a default project
---------------------

``project default [project name]`` allows you to update a default
project to your account.

.. code:: python

    cm project default fg2


.. parsed-literal::

    fg2 project is a default project now


.. code:: python

    cm project


.. parsed-literal::

    
    Project Information
    -------------------
    
       default: fg2
      projects: fg2, fg82, fg415
     completed: fg1003
    


You can see your default project has been changed from fg20 to fg82.
Note that ``cm project`` is same command with ``cm project info``.
``info`` option can be suppressed.

Set an active project
---------------------

You can add a project to your account as one of the active projects. You
can have multiple projects in your active project list.

.. code:: python

    cm project active fg415


.. parsed-literal::

    fg415 project is an active project(s) now


.. code:: python

    cm project info


.. parsed-literal::

    
    Project Information
    -------------------
    
       default: fg2
      projects: fg2, fg82, fg415
     completed: fg1003
    


You can see the new project ``fg415`` added to the active projects.

Change the status of project to ``completed``
---------------------------------------------

If your project is completed and no longer needed, you may want to
change the status from active to completed. ``completed`` option allows
to change the status of the selected project.

.. code:: python

    cm project completed fg415


.. parsed-literal::

    fg415 project is in a completed project(s)


.. code:: python

    cm project 


.. parsed-literal::

    
    Project Information
    -------------------
    
       default: fg2
      projects: fg2, fg82
     completed: fg1003, fg415
    


Add a project
-------------

You can use three commands to add a project. ``cm project active``
allows you to add a project to the active list. ``cm project default``
sets a default project. ``cm project completed`` adds a project to the
completed list. For example, you can add fg999 to the active like below.

.. code:: python

    cm project active fg999


.. parsed-literal::

    fg999 project is an active project(s) now


Delete a project
----------------

``project delete`` command simply performs the deletion of the given
project in the yaml file.

.. code:: python

    cm project delete fg999


.. parsed-literal::

    fg999 project is deleted


Help message
